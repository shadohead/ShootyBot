## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: kill_events Structure

**Source**: HenrikDev API documentation & Python API changelog

```json
"kill_events": [
  {
    "kill_time_in_round": 32892,          // milliseconds into the round

      {
        "puuid": "string"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Additional Fields (Unconfirmed)
- `weapon_guid`: Weapon used (reported as buggy for Chamber abilities)
- `damage`: Damage dealt
- `secondary_fire`: Boolean
- `wallbang`: Boolean (unclear if available)

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: damage_events Structure

**Source**: HenrikDev API documentation

```json
"damage_events": [
  {
    "receiver_puuid": "string",
    "receiver_display_name": "Henrik3#EUW3",
    "receiver_team": "Red|Blue",
    "bodyshots": 3,                      // shots that hit body in this damage instance
    "damage": 156,                       // total damage in this instance
    "headshots": 1,                      // shots that hit head in this damage instance
    "legshots": 0                        // shots that hit legs in this damage instance
  }
]
```

**Key Insight**: damage_events provides per-instance shot breakdown, not just match totals!

  "loadout_value": 4500  // total credits spent on weapons/armor this round
}
```

### Additional Economy Fields (Unconfirmed)
- `weapon`: Purchased weapon
- `armor`: Purchased armor
- `remaining`: Credits remaining after buy
- `spent`: Credits spent this round

---

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: ability_casts Structure

**Source**: Web search results from HenrikDev API documentation

```json
"ability_casts": {
  "c_casts": 2,  // Ability C uses
  "q_casts": 1,  // Ability Q uses
  "e_casts": 3,  // Ability E uses
  "x_casts": 1   // Ultimate (X) uses
}
```

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: plant/defuse Events

**Source**: Web search results from HenrikDev API documentation

```json

      "y": 5678
    },
    "plant_site": "A|B|C",
    "plant_time_in_round": 45000
  }
],
"defuse_events": [
  {
    "defuser_puuid": "string",
    "defuse_location": {
      "x": 1234,
      "y": 5678
    },
    "defuse_time_in_round": 75000
  }
]
```

## Player Locations (Unconfirmed but Likely Available)

**Source**: Web search mentions "player_locations with x, y coordinates and view_radians"

Likely structure:
```json
"player_locations": [
  {
    "player_puuid": "string",
    "x": 1234,
    "y": 5678,
    "view_radians": 3.14

## New Stats We Can Calculate

### HIGH PRIORITY (Confirmed Data Available)

#### 1. **Ability Usage Analysis** ‚úÖ
```python
# Data: ability_casts {c_casts, q_casts, e_casts, x_casts}
"‚ö° **UTILITY KING**: {player} used 45 abilities - maximum impact!"
"üé≠ **ULT MASTER**: {player} used ultimate 8 times!"
```

#### 2. **Plant/Defuse Heroes** ‚úÖ
```python
# Data: plant_events[], defuse_events[]
"üå± **SPIKE SPECIALIST**: {player} planted 7/10 rounds!"
"üõ†Ô∏è **DEFUSE KING**: {player} defused 3 times - clutch saves!"
```

#### 3. **Clutch Detection** ‚úÖ
```python
# Data: kill_time, survivor tracking
"üé≠ **CLUTCH MASTER**: {player} won 2 clutches (1v3, 1v2)!"
```

#### 4. **Entry Dueling** ‚úÖ
```python
# Data: kill_time_in_round for first kills
"‚öîÔ∏è **ENTRY GOD**: {player} won 5/7 opening duels (71%)!"
```

#### 5. **Eco Performance** ‚úÖ
```python
# Data: economy.loadout_value
"üí∞ **ECO WARRIOR**: {player} - 3 kills on <4k loadout rounds!"
```

#### 6. **Damage Per Instance Analysis** ‚úÖ
```python
# Data: damage_events with bodyshots/headshots/legshots per instance
"üéØ **ONE-TAP KING**: {player} averaged 135 damage/kill (efficient!)!"
"üò± **149 CURSE**: {player} dealt 140-149 damage 3 times without the kill!"
```

#### 7. **Team Display Names** ‚úÖ
```python
# Data: killer_display_name, victim_display_name in kill_events
# Can show actual names instead of just puuids
```

---

## Data NOT Available

### ‚ùå Cannot Detect:
- **Spam through smoke** - No smoke position/visibility data
- **Weapon mastery** - weapon_guid is buggy/unreliable
- **Wallbang detection** - Unconfirmed if wallbang flag exists
- **Distance of kills** - Would need player positions at kill time (may be available via player_locations)
- **Flash assists** - No blind/flash effect tracking
- **Angle/positioning quality** - Would need complex position analysis

---

## Recommendations

### Implement First (High Value + Confirmed Data):
1. **Ability usage stats** - Show who's using util effectively
2. **Plant/defuse recognition** - Reward objective play
3. **Clutch detection** - Most exciting for players
4. **Eco round performance** - Highlight skill in tough situations
5. **One-tap/149 damage curse** - Fun and informative

### Implement Next:
6. Entry duel win rate
7. Kill streak tracking
8. Round MVP frequency
9. Damage efficiency analysis
10. Opening duel timing analysis

---

## Notes

- v4 API is recommended over v2 (v2 will be deprecated eventually)
- API sometimes returns 403 even with valid keys (rate limiting or temporary issues)
- Some fields (like weapon_guid) are known to be buggy for certain abilities
- player_locations data needs verification but is mentioned in documentation
