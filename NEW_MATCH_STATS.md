# New Match Statistics Implementation

This document describes the new statistics added to the Epic Match Highlights section.

## Summary

Added **6 new stat categories** that utilize previously unused data from the Henrik API v2 match response:
- Ability usage tracking
- Plant/defuse hero recognition
- Clutch situation detection
- Eco round performance
- Entry duel win rates
- Damage efficiency (one-tap detection)

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. ⚡ Ability Usage Tracking

**Data Source**: `player_stats[].ability_casts` (per round)
- `c_casts`, `q_casts`, `e_casts`, `x_casts`

**Thresholds**:
- **Utility King**: 40+ total abilities used
- **Ult Master**: 6+ ultimates used

**Example Output**:
```
⚡ **UTILITY KING**: PlayerName (45 abilities used) - Maximum impact!
🎭 **ULT MASTER**: PlayerName (8 ultimates) - High-impact plays!
```

---

### 2. 🌱 Plant/Defuse Hero Recognition

**Data Source**: `rounds[].plant_events[]` and `rounds[].defuse_events[]`

**Thresholds**:
- **Spike Specialist**: 5+ plants
- **Defuse King**: 2+ defuses

**Example Output**:
```
🌱 **SPIKE SPECIALIST**: PlayerName (7 plants) - Objective focused!
🛠️ **DEFUSE KING**: PlayerName (3 defuses) - Clutch saves!
```

---

### 3. 🎭 Clutch Detection

**Data Source**: Round-by-round survivor analysis
- Detects 1v2, 1v3, 1v4, 1v5 situations
- Tracks attempts and wins

**Algorithm**:
1. For each round, determine who's alive at end
2. If one team has 1 player and other has 2+ players → clutch situation
3. Check if clutcher's team won the round

**Thresholds**:
- **Clutch Master**: 2+ clutch wins
- **Clutch Warrior**: 3+ attempts with 0 wins (honorable mention)

**Example Output**:
```
🎭 **CLUTCH MASTER**: PlayerName (2 1v3 wins) - Ice in their veins!
😰 **CLUTCH WARRIOR**: PlayerName (4 attempts) - Never give up!
```

---

### 4. 💰 Eco Round Performance

**Data Source**: `player_stats[].economy.loadout_value` (per round)

**Definition**: Eco round = loadout value < 4000 credits

**Tracking**:
- Kills secured during eco rounds
- Eco rounds won (when player's team wins)

**Thresholds**:
- Highlight if: 5+ eco kills OR 2+ eco round wins

**Example Output**:
```
💰 **ECO WARRIOR**: PlayerName (7 eco kills, 3 eco wins) - Budget beast!
```

---

### 5. ⚔️ Entry Duel Win Rate

**Data Source**: `kill_events` with `kill_time_in_round` timestamps

**Algorithm**:
1. Find first kill each round (sorted by `kill_time_in_round`)
2. Track which team wins the round
3. Calculate win rate for players who get first kills

**Thresholds**:
- **Entry God**: 5+ opening duels with 65%+ win rate
- **Entry Fragger**: 5+ opening duels with 55%+ win rate

**Example Output**:
```
⚔️ **ENTRY GOD**: PlayerName (6/8 opening duels won, 75%) - First blood king!
⚡ **ENTRY FRAGGER**: PlayerName (4/7 duels, 57%)
```

---

### 6. 🎯 One-Tap Detection

**Data Source**: `damage_events` per round, compared to kills

**Algorithm**:
1. Sum damage dealt in each round
2. Divide by kills in that round
3. Calculate average damage per kill across all rounds

**Threshold**: Average damage per kill ≤ 155 AND 10+ kills

**Why 155?**: Valorant headshot damage typically kills in 1-2 shots (140-160 damage)

**Example Output**:
```
🎯 **ONE-TAP GOD**: PlayerName (145 avg damage/kill) - Efficient eliminations!
```

## Code Location

**File**: `match_tracker.py`

**Functions Modified**:
- `_calculate_fun_match_stats()` (lines 413-1016)
  - Data collection: Lines 453-596
  - Highlight generation: Lines 900-1015

---

## Data Flow

```
Match Data (Henrik API)
    ↓
Round-by-Round Analysis Loop (lines 464-596)
    ↓
Stats Dictionaries:
  - ability_usage
  - plant_counts
  - defuse_counts
  - clutch_attempts/clutch_wins
  - eco_round_kills/eco_rounds_won
  - first_kill_rounds
  - damage_per_kill
    ↓
Highlight Generation (lines 900-1015)
    ↓
Discord Embed Field: "🎆 Epic Match Highlights"
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Required:
1. Run bot with real match data
2. Verify stats display correctly in Discord embeds
3. Check threshold tuning (may need adjustment based on real data)

### Test Scenarios:
- Match with high ability usage (Viper, Brimstone players)
- Match with plants/defuses (competitive matches)
- Match with clutch situations (close rounds)
- Match with eco rounds (pistol rounds, force buys)
- Match with high entry fragging
- Match with Sheriff/Marshal kills (one-taps)

### Known Limitations:
1. **Clutch detection** is heuristic-based (survivors = alive players)
2. **Damage per kill** tracks individual damage events to killed targets
3. **Plant/defuse events** may not be present in older API versions
4. **Ability casts** may not be available in all match data

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Pistol round performance** - Track Round 1 and Round 13 specifically
2. **Save round detection** - Identify and highlight save round performance
3. **Comeback factor** - Performance when team is losing (0-5 deficit)
4. **Agent ability efficiency** - Specific ability usage patterns (smokes, flashes, etc.)
5. **Position-based stats** - If player location data becomes available

### Threshold Tuning:
Current thresholds are estimates and should be adjusted based on real-world data:
- Ability usage: 40 abilities may be too high/low
- Clutch detection: May want to weight 1v4/1v5 more than 1v2
- Eco round: 4000 credit threshold may need adjustment
- One-tap: 155 damage threshold may need refinement

---

## Performance Considerations

**Impact**: Minimal
- All new calculations happen in existing round loop
- No additional API calls required
- Additional memory: ~7 dictionaries tracking player stats
- Computational complexity: O(n*m) where n = rounds, m = players (same as before)

**Optimization**: Already using existing round data structures - no redundant iteration.

---

## Notes

- All new stats use data that was previously fetched but not analyzed
- No changes to API calling patterns or rate limiting
- Backward compatible: If data fields are missing, stats simply won't display
- Follows existing highlight pattern: check threshold → add to highlights list
