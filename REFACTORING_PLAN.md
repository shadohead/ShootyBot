# ShootyBot Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for ShootyBot to improve code cleanliness, maintainability, and organization.

## Current State Analysis

### Key Issues Identified:

1. **Code Duplication** (~15% of codebase)
   - Atomic JSON write functions repeated across multiple files
   - User formatting logic duplicated
   - Repeated error handling patterns

2. **Inconsistent Patterns**
   - Mixed Discord response handling approaches
   - Inconsistent logging and error messages
   - Wildcard imports from config

3. **Missing Abstractions**
   - No base classes for common patterns
   - No data validation layer
   - No event system for components

4. **Poor Separation of Concerns**
   - Multiple responsibilities in single classes
   - Business logic mixed with presentation
   - Data persistence mixed with API calls

5. **Complex Functions**
   - Large functions doing multiple things (160+ lines)
   - Deeply nested logic
   - Complex conditionals

6. **Type Hints Coverage** (<10%)

7. **Configuration Issues**
   - Mixed config sources
   - Hardcoded values
   - No validation

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Priority 1)
1. Create base classes and utilities
2. Extract common functionality
3. Improve error handling infrastructure
4. Standardize logging patterns

### Phase 2: Organization (Priority 2)
1. Split complex functions
2. Add comprehensive type hints
3. Improve separation of concerns
4. Standardize command patterns

### Phase 3: Polish (Priority 3)
1. Enhance configuration management
2. Add data validation layer
3. Implement event system
4. Improve documentation

## Implementation Order

1. **Create utilities module** - Extract common functions
2. **Refactor bot.py** - Clean up main entry point
3. **Improve data layer** - Better abstractions for data management
4. **Standardize commands** - Consistent patterns across cogs
5. **Clean up Valorant integration** - Better separation of concerns
6. **Add type hints** - Throughout the codebase
7. **Enhance error handling** - Consistent patterns everywhere
8. **Polish configuration** - Better organization and validation

## Success Metrics

- Code duplication reduced to <5%
- Type hint coverage >90%
- All functions <50 lines
- Consistent patterns throughout
- All tests passing
- No functionality lost
