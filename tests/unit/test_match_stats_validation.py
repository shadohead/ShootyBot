    This test validates the calculate_player_stats method against known data
    from tracker.gg match: dae1b62d-c3dd-4663-9131-2771c7f66b5a
    
    The test ensures that our Henrik API stat calculations produce results
    identical to those shown on tracker.gg, validating accuracy of:
    
    EXACT MATCHES (vs tracker.gg):
    - Kills, Deaths, Assists (KDA)
    - Average Damage per Round (ADR) 
    - Headshot percentage
    - K/D and KDA ratios
    - Plus/Minus (+/-) - kills minus deaths
    - Score/TRS (Team Round Score)
    - Win/Loss tracking
    - Agent and map tracking
    - Damage Delta (DD) - damage dealt vs received per round
    
    ALGORITHMIC VALIDATION (without round data):
    - KAST% (estimated via kills+assists impact)
    - First Bloods/Deaths (estimated via KPR)
    - Multikills (estimated for high KPR â‰¥2.5)
    - Advanced stats structure and bounds checking
